<h3>Casa Code-unale</h3>

This is a web app I made so I could learn about web development and the MEAN stack. I'm not super invested in the idea of trying to get users for the site, but feel free to join or invite your friends if you like the idea!

<h5>Currently working on:</h5>
<ul>
<li>building more sophisticated tests</li>
<li>integrating email notifications</li>
<li>enabling messaging between users</li>
</ul>


Happy to hear any suggestions for the improvement of the app. Thanks!
